# Integration between Google and Salesforce to create Gmail for customers
The purpose of this project is to build a workflow to create Gmail account for customer when the opportunity is saved at a certain stage of the sales process and send the login credentials to customer. However, this repo only focuses on the Apex classes that are invoked by a Process Builder to generate the Gmail username, check for duplication, create the Gmail account via API, and save the Gmail username to the opportunity.
